Easy Resizer is a free online image resizing tool designed for batch resizing images.
Official website: https://easyresizer.com

Easy Resizer supports 5 resizing modes: Auto Width or Height, Fixed Width and Height, Max Width and Height, Proportional Scaling, and Proportional Filling.

1. Auto Width or Height: Enter the width or height of the image, and the tool will automatically calculate and adjust the other side's dimensions based on the original aspect ratio, ensuring the image's proportions remain undistorted. This method is very useful when you only want to fix one dimension.

2. Fixed Width and Height: This is the stretch mode, where you set the width and height of the image precisely to ensure it fits the specified dimensions. If the aspect ratio of the set dimensions does not match the original image, it may cause the image to stretch and distort.

3. Maximum Width and Height: Set the maximum width and height of the image. The tool will automatically scale the image to fit within these dimensions while maintaining the original aspect ratio, ensuring that neither the width nor the height of the image exceeds the set values. You can set one or both values.

4. Scale Proportionally: Adjust the image size according to the specified scaling percentage while maintaining the original aspect ratio, ensuring that the image appearance does not distort. When the scale value is less than 100, it scales down the image, whereas when the scale value is greater than 100, it scales up the image. For example, setting it to 200 means the image will be scaled to twice its current width and height.

5. Fill Proportionally: This mode combines resizing the image with filling the background, ensuring that the image maintains its proportion within the specified size range while filling or completing the remaining space. It allows the image to keep the same proportion and supports setting the aspect ratio size and background color for filling.

All the core logic code will be updated in the future, If you want to resize images in bulk, please go directly to the website to use, everything is free and supports batch processing.
